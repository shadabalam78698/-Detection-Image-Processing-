EMOTION DETECTION USING IMAGE PROCESSING

A Brief Explaination About The Project:
In this project, user's emotion using its facial expressions will be detected. These expressions can be derived from the live feed via system's camera or any pre-exisiting image available in the memory. Emotions possessed by humans can be recognized and has a vast scope of study in the computer vision industry upon which several researches have already been done. The work has been implemented using Python (Open Source Computer Vision Library (OpenCV) and NumPy. The scanned image(testing dataset) is being compared to the training dataset and thus emotion is predicted. The objective of this project is to develop a system which can analyze the image and predict the expression of the person.
